This package depends on the package manager
Spike and that the environment variable SPIKE_PATH
is exported.

The part of Spike that is used is dragonsuite.py.
It is used for two things:

*  Abstraction from Python and unification with Spike scrolls

*  Persistence of the --shred option passed to Spike


To port ptools to other distro:s (that do not use Spike)
you can either:

*  Replace all dragonsuite calls with functions provided
   by Python

*  Include dragonsuite.py from Spike and adapt all files
   accordingly.


Yes, I do not like this either, but I do think it is
better than builting it into Spike.
